# Pathfinding

For both of the files, you should be able to place the obstacles by using mouse. Then you can start the simulation by pressing 'SPACEBAR'.
Furthermore, for Dijkstra algorithm, you can choose to draw the weight between the squares by pressing 'RIGHT' on your keyboard. Green line
should indicate weight of 2, blue line is for 3 and brown line is for 0.5, which is 0.5 less than usual path. Then you can press 'SPACEBAR'
to enjoy the fun.
